### Current Functionality
- When hear mentions of "hungry" or "food", tells you top 3 restaurants by rating in your area
- Can show you favorite piece of art if prompt with "discover" or "art" and then will either lead you to websites or show you art piece depending on conversation
- "Help" will give you list of options
- Words "color" or "colorpicker" will give you a quicklink to a color picker website

### Errors
